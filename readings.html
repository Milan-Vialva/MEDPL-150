      <h1>Reading and Writing Response #1</h1>
        
      <p>Taking photos used to seem forced sometimes. When my grandpa would ask me to pose for a photo when I didn’t want to, or I didn’t feel like it, I would have to put on a smile but still make it seem like I meant it. It’s not that every time I had to, I didn’t like it; it’s just that it gradually started to feel like something I had to do for every occasion instead of wanting to do it, which I think took a lot of the beauty out of it and made the image seem fake. With that being said, as I got older and started looking back on these same photos, I started to feel really grateful for having something to remember and reflect on, like “oh, I was being moody that day” or “that was the day I had a gymnastics show”. Photography for me now is capturing the moment, whether imperfect, hilarious, or pretty. It’s all beautiful. I enjoy the photos where I’m looking off, or I’m laughing, or I’m side eyeing the camera because it becomes evidence of that memory. I use photography as a lookbook, as a form of long-term content that captures moments in my life. I like that photography lets me have something to show people, either about something I thought was funny or about that one trip I went on. Photography in the moment allows me to document something, even though it is just a snapshot of the moment, when I look back, I can remember the moment. I think of image-making as a way to enhance certain qualities with creative notions. Doodles that make the image fun or editing it some way that makes people double glance at it and say “oh that’s creative” or “how did they do that”. I do agree with the points Sontag spoke about, like how modern society experiences the world increasingly through images rather than direct experiences, and how that trickles into replacing understanding and image that is trying to educate, with a mere appearance of something. I think gradually, as the internet becomes more accessible, especially to even younger generations, that type of brain development might become more apparent in people's understanding of images. How personal images are viewed is obviously so different from how you’ll view something on Instagram, because you don’t know the backstory of that person’s photo. I personally think what turns a random photo more meaningful is words, if there’s a description that adds a reason or purpose to the photo. Someone can see an image and feel nothing because they are used to seeing it online, but if there’s something written that can be done by someone who knows the backstory of the photo, I think that can make people more knowledgeable or want to know more in general. I think using photography or illustrations and text, if used in the moment it’s trying to capture and share, can really emulate, to an extent, what they are trying to show others, and it will be acknowledged/understood.</p>
