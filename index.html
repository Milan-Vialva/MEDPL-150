        <h1>Hello, my name is Milan</h1>
        <h3>Welcome to my MEDPL 150 portfolio site!</h3>
        <p> I am in my sophomore year and am majoring in media studies. I am from Trinidad, a small Caribbean island. Now that I'm living in New York, after frequently visiting, I realized there are so many opportunities and possibilities when it comes to creative spaces, which always seemed very limited to me back home. 
            
            I enjoy a lot of creative interests, like performance arts, behind-the-scenes clips of movie-making, and even more niche things, like watching the early sketches of animated characters compared to the final product. I really enjoy different forms of creative expression as someone who has a lot of interests. It's very intriguing to me how others are able to express themselves through their chosen art form.
            
            In MEDPL 150, I hope to refresh some skills I learned when I used Replit to make a website before, while also learning new tips and techniques. I am also looking forward to learning about photography and the different aspects that go into it. 
            
            This site will  serve as my portfolio and will hold all the work throughout the semester. I aim to become more knowledgeable on new forms of creativity and see how I can incorporate them into my own life and future aspirations. </p>

        <h3>Reflection</h3>
        <p> As I was figuring out HTML, I also remembered similar steps I did when using Replit, but it was still a learning curve. Remembering certain tags and tag endings was definitely a tedious part to make sure the product came out right. However, it felt very rewarding when I did figure out something I was stuck on. </p>
