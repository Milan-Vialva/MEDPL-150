        <h1>Hello, my name is Milan</h1>
        <p>Welcome to my MEDPL 150 portfolio site! I am in my sophomore year and am majoring in media studies. I enjoy a lot of creative interests like performance arts,  behind the scenes clips of the making of movies and even more niche things like watching the beginning sketches of an animated charcters compared to the final product. I really enjoy different forms of creative expression as somone who has a lot of interest. It's very intriguing to me how others are able to express themselves through their chosen art form.  </p>
